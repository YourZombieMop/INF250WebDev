				<h2>Jacob's PC Emporium</h2>
				<p>
					Jacob builds custom gaming computers and sells them to people. He has an astounding technical knowledge of
					hardware, but his website looked dated and he was running out of customers in his area.
				</p>
				<p>
					We prepared a brand redesign and marketing plan for him. We mentored his sales team to target audiences on the
					web and helped him set up an e-commerce site. Now, his business fills orders for clients across the country!

				<h2>Astelle's Family Bakery</h2>
				<p>
					Astelle's Family Bakery has been locally-owned and operated for over 20 years. They have served their
					community
					with intense passion. However, sadly you weren't be able to see that from their outdated website.
				</p>
				<p>
					We brought their style to the web to build their local presence and increase their reach in their community.
					We
					also brought their business to the top of digital advertising providers with Google Adservices.

				<h2>Aaron's Canned Carwash</h2>

					Aaron may have canned his carwash business due to feeling overworked, but before he did that, I was able to
					ramp up his customer base and gave him his hardest work week in the lifetime of his business's operation!
