      <h2>What is skateboarding?</h2>
      <p>
        Skateboarding is a form of recreation & sport where a person rides a small board that is mounted on wheels. It
        is very individualistic and skaters often use it as a form of expression.
      </p>
      <h2>Why do you like skateboarding?</h2>
      <p>
        I love skateboarding because I'm able to use it as a way to escape from my busy mind. If I'm stressed about
        something and I'm looking for a distraction, I can always pick up my board and just go. It allows for me to take
        the time to address my thoughts and feelings in a healthy way. My experience with skating has been deeply
        impactful and positive.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's one of the few things in my life that I can reserve to just do for myself; and I can never get bored with
        it. There's always another trick or challenge to attempt. Skateboarding has been a great part of my life and I
        don't want to let go of the hobby anytime soon.

      <h2>Types of Skateboarding</h2>
      <p>
        There are many kinds of ways to ride a skateboard. Some of the most popular forms of riding a board are
        described below.
      </p>
      <h3>Cruising</h3>
      <p>
        Cruising is when a skater is using their board to travel. This is how most skateboarders learned to ride. People
        who enjoy cruising might try many kinds of skateboards like longboards or electric skateboards. Sometimes when
        cruising, skaters will try to go as fast as possible along a path or travel to a destination in a short period
        of time as a challenge.
      </p>
      <h3>Trick Skating</h3>
      <p>
        Trick skating is when a skateboarder will perform difficul maneuvers with their skateboard as a challenge. There
        are many kinds of tricks a skater might do which include flat-ground tricks, street tricks, vert tricks, and
        park tricks.
      </p>
      <h3>Freestyle Skating</h3>
      <p>
        Freestyle skating takes trick skating to a whole new level. When freestyling, a skateboarder will perform
        multiple improvised or coreographed tricks in succession, sometimes to music. This is my favorite kind of
        skating to watch!
