		<h2>Favorite 3 Songs</h2>
		<ol type="1">
			<li>
				Hold On Till May
				<p>
					This song is about a partner with a planned suicide date in May due to their trauma. The singer tried to do
					everything they could to support their partner, but their attempts to help were deflected by the partner and
					disregarded as attempts to hurt them. The song is a reflection after the suicide which expresses the pain
					that the singer felt at the realization that their partner chose to let go of the intense love which they
					shared in favor of death.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				I'm Low On Gas and You Need a Jacket
				<p>
					This song is about someone who keeps doing things which are harmful, but rather than accepting fault and
					addressing the issues, they make excuses. The singer is running out of energy to support this person, and the
					song is a reflection upon their relationship as it dies.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				The Sky Under the Sea
				<p>
					This song is about a love interest who uses the singer for their selfish desires while the singer is deeply
					in love with the person. The singer feels that they would do anything to keep their love interest happy, even
					at the expense of their own health.
