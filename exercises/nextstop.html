      <h2>Destinations</h2>
      <p>
        There are so many things to see at Yellowstone National Park.
      </p>
      <h3>Grand Prismatic Spring</h3>
      <p>
        The Grand Prismatic Spring is a colorful spring on the Midway Geyser Basin Trail. It's bigger than a football
        field and deeper than a 10-story building. The rainbow colors of this beautiful landmark are a staple of the
        Yellowstone experience.
      </p>
      <h3>Upper Geyser Basin Trail</h3>
      <p>
        The Upper Geyser Basin Trail contains around 25% of the world's geysers. There are tons of walking paths which
        pass many geothermal features. Make sure to stop by Old Faithful if you visit to see the geysers!
      </p>
      <h3>Lamar Valley</h3>
      <p>
        Lamar Valley has some of the most spectacular natural views. Bison and other animals love this area and it is
        further removed from tourism than other places like Hayden Vallen. This is a prime location to observe wildlife
        such as wild bison, elk, bears, and wolves.
      </p>
      <h3>Mammoth Hot Springs</h3>
      <p>
        Mammoth Hot Springs is a beautiful desitantion with vastly different geothermal features than the Geyser Basin
        Trails. It's accessible by road and by foot, so it's a great place to adventure or just tour by vehicle to see
        the scenes.
      </p>
      <h3>Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River</h3>
      <p>
        The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River is over 24 miles long and spans up to 4,000 feet wide. Some parts
        reach as deep as 1,200 feet. There are tons of walking trails and views. Most tourists only visit the main
        viewpoints, so it's a wonderful destination to get away from the other tourists for your own adventure.
      </p>
      <h3>Yellowstone Lake</h3>
      <p>
        Yellowstone Lake is the highest elevated lake in North America. It is extremely cold, even in the summer; the
        best way to visit the lake is by boat or kayak. There are many hiking trails which lead to the lake, so it can
        also make for a hiking destination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yellowstone has many great features which makes it a great destination for my next vacation.
